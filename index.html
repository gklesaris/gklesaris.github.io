The festival includes fall foods, pumpkins, arts and crafts, and plenty of other autumn activities. The event was successful in bringing over 1000 members of the Stevens Community together. Originally introduced in 2014, Greg thought it would be best to develop the concepts of the event further before reintroducing it to the Stevens Community in 2017, when it was named a “Campus Tradition” by the Assistant Vice President for Student Affairs.</p>

Stevens Community members take both classroom and field training to ensure that they are ready to pilot the million dollar balloons down the streets of Manhattan. After spending 20 hours on Thanksgiving Eve inflating the balloons, Stevens Community members wake up at 4am on Thanksgiving Day to prepare their vehicle teams for the balloon’s flight! Greg was the Assistant Anchor Vehicle Manager on the “Hello Kitty” float for this past year’s Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, making sure the balloon stayed perfectly without the bounds of the NYC streets.</p>

Stevens is located in the 4th densest city in the United States, Hoboken, meaning that they must be conscious of how events affect the community. During Move-In Day more than 1000 cars, buses, and trucks drive through the entrance of campus. It is imperative that the flow of traffic through the entrance stays steady and does not bottleneck. For the last 3 years, Greg Klesaris has been in charge of the operation of the entrance and first residence hall to make sure that traffic flows smoothly and that students moving into the first residence hall unload efficiently.</p>
