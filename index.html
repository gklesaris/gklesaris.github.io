Stevens Community members take both classroom and field training to ensure that they are ready to pilot the million dollar balloons down the streets of Manhattan. After spending 20 hours on Thanksgiving Eve inflating the balloons, Stevens Community members wake up at 4am on Thanksgiving Day to prepare their vehicle teams for the balloon’s flight!</p>

              <p class="card-text">Over 800 nervous First-Year Students move into their residence halls in the middle of August at Stevens. This day takes coordination from almost every department. Stevens is located in the 4th densest city in the United States, Hoboken, meaning that they must be conscious of how events affect the community. During Move-In Day more than 1000 cars, buses, and trucks drive through the entrance of campus. It is imperative that the flow of traffic through the entrance stays steady and does not bottleneck. For the last 3 years, Greg Klesaris has been in charge of the operation of the entrance and first residence hall to make sure that traffic flows smoothly and that students moving into the first residence hall unload efficiently.</p>
